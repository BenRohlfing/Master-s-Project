# Master-s-Project

This is my Master's Project that I completed as a requirement to graduate at SIUE with a Masters Degree in Statistics. The project deals with propensity scores and their applications in determining treatment effect in observational studies and achieving balance among covariates.

The Master's Project Paper is the formal report I submitted that outlines the theory behind the project and real-world implementation.

The Master's Project Beamer Presentation is the Beamer I used in the presentation of the project to a panel of three professors in the SIUE Mathematics and Statistics Department, one of which was my project advisor.

The Example Code - RHC is the code used to run the example in Section 9 of the report. The idea for using this example came from the paper Balancing Covariates via Propensity Score Weighting, which is also included in the documentation here on GitHub. The dataset used for this example is given as the csv file rhc.

The Simulation Code is the code used to run the simulation in Section 10 of the report. The idea for this simulation is based on the simulation run in Addression Extreme Propensity Scores via the Overlap Weights. This paper is also included in the project documentation.
